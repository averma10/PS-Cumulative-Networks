## Read graphs for Day1 and Day2

```{r C2}

```

## Summary of Day1 and Day2 graphs

```{r C3}
```

## Create grades 1-5 for students
Create new vertex attribute ```grade``` based on the current ```classname``` attribute. Students are assigned to grades 1-5 and teachers are assigned to grade 6.
```{r C4}

```


## Log-Log plot for Contact Duration comparison of Day 1 and Day 2
```{r C5}

```

## Log-Log plot for Number of contacts made in a day by different pairs of individuals
```{r C6}

```

## Network Filtering
a) Delete edges with contact duration less than 2mins.
b) Delete edges with number of contacts less than 2.
c) Assign contact duration value as new edge weights.
```{r C7}

```

## Save the new networks and create visualizations in gephi
```{r C8}

```

### Day 1
The high degree nodes have larger size than the low degree nodes. The color of nodes represent grades. Pink - 1, green- 2, skyblue-3, darkgray-4, orange-5. The edge weight represents total contact duration between two nodes.
```{r,out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Visualization_day1.png")
```

### Day 2
The high degree nodes have larger size than the low degree nodes. The color of nodes represent grades. Pink - 1, green- 2, skyblue-3, darkgray-4, orange-5. The edge weight represents total contact duration between two nodes.
```{r,out.width="800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Visualization_day2.png")
```


## Homophily across the classrooms
```{r C9}

```


## Homophily across different grades
```{r C10}

```

## CUG test for Assortativity by gender
```{r C11a}

```


## CUG test for Assortativity by grade
```{r C11b}

```


## QAP test for Assortativity by gender
```{r C12a}

```


## QAP test for Assortativity by grade
```{r C12b}

```


## ERGM Models
We are implementing ERGM model on a ```grade 1``` network which is a very simple version of the network. Due to high computational requirements of this model, it was not possible to run this model to check the homophily within multiple grades. 
```{r C13}

```

Load all saved ergm models.
```{r C14load}

```


###Model 1: Edges and nodemix classname
1B-1B is considered as base.
```{r C15}

```
####M1: GOF
```{r C15a}

```

###Model 2: Edges, class nodemix and degree
M1 + degree(10)
```{r C16}

```
####M2: GOF
```{r C16a}

```

Model is a good fit for degree and esp.

####M2: Diagnostics
```{r C16b}

```

Let us try something else to see if auto-correlation and Geweke statistics can be improved further.

###Model 2a: Model 2 with Geweke tweaks
```{r C17}

```

####M2a: GOF
```{r C17a}

```

####M2a: Diagnostics
```{r C17b}

```

###Model 3: Differentiating High degree nodes by gender
```{r C18}

```

####M3: GOF
```{r C18a}

```

####M3: Diagnostics
```{r C18b}

```
The Geweke statistics are week in this model. Try changing burnin value

###Model 3a: Model 3 with Gweke tweaks
```{r C19}

```
####M3a: GOF
```{r C19a}

```

####M3b: Diagnostics
```{r C19b}

```

#####The best model for ```classname``` is Model 2 with edges, nodemix and degree 10.

###Model 6: edges and nodemix ```gender``` 
```{r C20}

```

####M6: GOF
```{r C20a}

```
###Model 7: M6 + degree(10)
```{r C21}

```

####M7: GOF
```{r C21a}

```

Model is not a good fit for edgewise-shared parter. 

####M7: Diagnostics
```{r C21b}

```

Geweke statistics are very low. There is a high chance that the means of 1st 10% of iterations and last 50% of iterations came from same distribution.

Let us try to Fit GOF model using gwesp

###Other Models tried to fit for gender mix
```{r C22}

```

###Model 14: Combine M2 and M7 ie mix classname, mix gender and homophily for gender at degree 10.
```{r C23}

```

####M14: GOF
```{r C23a}

```
GOF for this model shows good results. Let us check diagnostics.

####M14: Diagnostics
```{r C23b}

```
Cross-correlation, auto-correlation and Geweke stats are good. Overall this model is good, but let us try one more model with nodematch on gender.

###Model 16: Edges, nodemix ```classname```, nodematch ```gender``` and degree 10
```{r C24}

```

####M16: GOF
```{r C24a}

```

Goodness of Fit shows good results for this model.

####M16: Diagnostics
```{r C24b}

```

Cross-correlation and auto-correlation values are high, but Geweke statistics show low p-value. Let us try increasing the sample interval.

###Model 16a: M16 with Geweke tweaks
```{r C25}

```

####M16a: GOF
```{r C25a}

```

####M16a: Diagnostics
```{r C25b}

```

p-value is high now. This means that samples came from different distributions. We will use this model for grade1 network of day 2.

###Implement Model 16a to Grade 1 network of day-2
```{r C26load}

```

```{r C27}

```

####M16a: Day2 GOF
```{r C27a}

```

####M16a: Diagnostics
```{r C27b}

```
p-value is high. Cross-correlation and auto correlation values are high too. Overall a good model.


###Simulated versions of Day 1 and Day 2 Models
The pink nodes represent Female students and blue nodes represent Male students. The two groups visible in the graph are for class A and B.
```{r C28, out.width='800px'}

```

### Edge Probability of Female-Female edge vs Male-Male edge for both days
```{r C29}

```

For grade 1 network, the edge probability is high for Male-Male nodes for both the days. Males have almost same interaction for both days within grade 1 network. For Females interacted less on day2 as compared to day1.

### ERGM Limitations
The above ERGM model only simulates the Grade1 network. We should know that there are total 5 grades where these stats may be different. These grades have exhibit both inter-grade and intra-grade connections. Hence, this model and finding should not be genralized for any other part of the network or whole network.

###Future Works
We can try to fit this model one by one on each grade seperately and try to fit this model for 2grades at a time. If this works then we may be able to study the network characteristics more accurately.
